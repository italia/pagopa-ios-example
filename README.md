# Running the example

This example should run out of the box, if you open the project files with XCode.


## Using the SDK

While we are working to open up the source code of the SDK, you can already use its binary version.

To initialize the SDK instance:

```.objc
PagoPACore * pagoPACore = [[PagoPACore alloc] init];
```

To initialize a payment, it is necessary to use the following method, from a `viewController`:

```.objc
[pagoPACore startPaymentSessionWithPaymentId:paymentId presentingViewController:self delegate:self];
```

The delegate will receive the payment events: completed, failed, or canceled by the user.

```.objc
-(void) pagoPACore:(PagoPACore *) pagoPACore didCompletePayment:

(PagoPAPayment *) payment;
{
  // payment completed with success
}

-(void) pagoPACorePaymentFailed:(PagoPACore *) pagoPACore;
{
  // payment failed
}

-(void) pagoPACorePaymentAbortedByUser:(PagoPACore *) pagoPACore; {
  // payment canceled by the user
}
```

**Warning**: while all of the source code of the SDK is available under an open license, we advise you NOT to change the workflow of the payment for the user, as it is implemented this way for security reasons. All changes to this workflow will result in your application not being approved by AgID for the production environment.

# Installing the dependencies

Install Carthage from https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage

Run `carthage update`

Download `wallet_core_sdk.framework` from the latest binary release, and add it to the build folder of Carthage frameworks.

Add the following libraries to Carthage: `MBProgressHUD.framework`, `PureLayout.framework`, `SDWebImage.framework` e `wallet_core_sdk.framework`

To do so, follow these steps (extracted from Carthage documentation):

On your application targets’ “Build Phases” settings tab, click the “+” icon and choose “New Run Script Phase”. Create a Run Script in which you specify your shell (ex: `/bin/sh`), add the following contents to the script area below the shell:

```.bash
/usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks
```

Add the paths to the frameworks you want to use under “Input Files”, e.g.:

```
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/MBProgressHUD.framework
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/PureLayout.framework
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/SDWebImage.framework
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/wallet_core_sdk.framework
```

Add the paths to the copied frameworks to the “Output Files”, e.g.:

```
$(BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR)/$(FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH)/MBProgressHUD.framework
$(BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR)/$(FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH)/PureLayout.framework
$(BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR)/$(FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH)/SDWebImage.framework
$(BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR)/$(FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH)/wallet_core_sdk.framework
```

With output files specified alongside the input files, Xcode only needs to run the script when the input files have changed or the output files are missing. This means dirty builds will be faster when you haven't rebuilt frameworks with Carthage.
